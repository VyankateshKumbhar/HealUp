Risk Management and Configuration Management Plan for OPD Management System

1. Risk Management Plan

1.1 Objective

To recognize, evaluate, and address potential challenges to ensure the efficient development and implementation of the OPD management system.

1.2 Risk Identification

Risk ID | Risk Description
--------|----------------------------------------------------------
R1      | Issues in synchronizing the system with hospital databases.
R2      | Lack of clear communication between medical staff and development teams.
R3      | Uncontrolled expansion of requirements leading to project delays.
R4      | Threats to patient data confidentiality and integrity.
R5      | Ineffective user interface resulting in staff reluctance to use the system.
R6      | System downtime causing interruptions in hospital operations.

1.3 Risk Assessment

Risk ID | Likelihood | Category         | Impact | Priority
--------|------------|------------------|--------|----------
R1      | Medium     | Integration      | High   | High
R2      | High       | Collaboration    | Medium | High
R3      | Medium     | Scope Management | Medium | Medium
R4      | High       | Data Security    | High   | Critical
R5      | Medium     | Usability        | High   | High
R6      | Low        | Reliability      | High   | Medium

1.4 Risk Mitigation Plan

Risk ID | Mitigation Strategy
--------|----------------------------------------------------------
R1      | Engage with hospital IT teams early and allocate extra time for integration challenges.
R2      | Establish structured communication channels and conduct periodic alignment meetings.
R3      | Maintain a well-documented requirement list and control feature additions through a review process.
R4      | Implement encryption protocols and conduct regular security assessments.
R5      | Gather user feedback through pilot testing and improve interface design iteratively.
R6      | Deploy a scalable cloud solution and set up real-time system monitoring.

1.5 Monitoring and Reporting

Conduct weekly evaluations of identified risks.

Maintain a dynamic risk registry on GitHub and update it with any new developments.
