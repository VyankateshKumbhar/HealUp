1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Purpose 
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) describes the software requirements for HealUp, an OPD-simplifying platform aimed at enhancing patient experience through digitalization. This document covers features such as digital prescriptions, appointment booking, and turn notification systems based on feedback from 10 survey responses. 
 
1.2 Document Conventions 
The SRS follows industry-standard typographical conventions, with bold for feature names, italic for emphasis, and regular font for general text. Requirements are presented with sequential identifiers (e.g., REQ-1, REQ-2). Priorities are indicated as High, Medium, or Low. 
 
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions 
This document is intended for developers, project managers, and testers. Readers should begin with the overview sections (Introduction, Product Description) to gain an understanding of the platform's goals and then proceed to the specific system features and requirements sections relevant to their roles. 
 
1.4 Project Scope 
The scope of the HealUp project is to provide a platform that simplifies the OPD process, focusing on key features based on user feedback. The platform aims to enhance patient satisfaction by offering features like digital prescriptions, appointment booking, and turn notification systems.
